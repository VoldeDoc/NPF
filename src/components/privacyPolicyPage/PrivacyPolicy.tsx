                        <li>Communication and Complaint Resolution: We may process your personal data to communicate with you and resolve complaints or issues related to our services.</li>
                        <li>Sensitive Personal Data for Insurance Purposes: We may process sensitive personal data, such as health data, when it is necessary for the provision of insurance coverage, particularly when such data is essential to the insurance policy.</li>
